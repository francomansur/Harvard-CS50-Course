## Notes

The code in this repository was developed and tested in the **CS50 Codespace** environment. This environment provides an automatic and pre-configured setup, ensuring that all projects run smoothly without additional adjustments.

### Important:
- When running the code locally, you may need to manually configure certain aspects, such as environment variables, dependencies, or specific paths.
- Make sure all required dependencies are installed and that your local environment is properly configured.
