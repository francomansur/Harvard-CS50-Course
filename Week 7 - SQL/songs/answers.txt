// Calculate AVG (energy, valence, danceability) and Aura

SELECT AVG(energy) AS avg_energy, AVG(valence) AS avg_valence, AVG(danceability) AS avg_danceability
FROM songs;

// Better ways of calculating aura

Considering a higher weight for songs that users listen to more frequently and providing an aura related to the time frame might be more accurate in reflecting their current preferences. This approach would require a "play count" column for each song to account for how often a user listens to each track. Additionally, it would be beneficial to generate an aura for each month and then determine a final aura based on the most common monthly aura throughout the year. This method accounts for changes in musical tastes over time and provides a more comprehensive representation of the listener's preferences.
